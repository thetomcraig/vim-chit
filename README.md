### Vim Chit
Vim plugin for [chit command line tool](https://github.com/thetomcraig/chit).

### Usage
To change the theme, use the command `:ChitSetTheme <theme_name>`.  
You can use TAB to cycle through chit themes.  
Setting the theme with `vim-chit` will invoke `chit` to set the theme everywhere.

### Installation
Install with your vim package manager of choice.
For example, with [Vim plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):
```
Plug 'thetomcraig/vim-chit'
```
__NOTE:__ I have not tested with others yet.
